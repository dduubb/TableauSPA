<p class=MsoNormal>Here are the bits of text I have in the viz right now, I may
have to serve these up as little webpages to have better formatting. Anyway I
do it we will have control of this even after IT does their thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are the places I have right now for text, the stream
of consciousness filler text I&#8217;m using now below. I can add logic to
change bits of text with the variables in the dashboard. I can add different
text depending on the tri as well if there&#8217;s a point to make there.&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal>Property owners have the right to understand how their tax
dollars are used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Search for your Name, Address or PIN (available on your
tax bill) to see how your latest tax bill changed.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will show you a list of the taxing agencies (schools,
libraries, police, parks and many more) in your neighborhood and the ones that
had the largest effect on the bill. Many factors influence your tax bill, not
only the value of your property but also the value of all of the properties
around you and the budget requests of the agencies that provide the services
that we all use and create value for you and your neighbors' homes and
businesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>0.00% decrease/increase</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You might be wondering why these changes can vary greatly?
This might seem confusing at first, but it's all about complex interplay of
reassessments, appeals, and the distribution of the tax burden across different
types of properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taxing Agency Changes: The amount of money that needs to be
collected from property taxes (the levy) typically doesn't decrease just
because property values do. Local governments still need a certain amount of
money to provide services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Bill changes: As a homeowner, even if the value of your
home hasn't increased, you might find that your property tax bill goes up
because of the reduced contributions from commercial properties. On top of
that, if you're not aware of or you're not claiming all the tax exemptions
you're eligible for, you're missing out on potential savings. It&#8217;s like
leaving money on the table that could otherwise lower your bill. For example,
if there&#8217;s a homestead exemption that reduces the taxable value of your
home and you don't apply for it, you'll end up with a higher tax bill than
necessary. So it's important to check with the Assessor's Office to see if you
qualify for any exemptions to reduce your share of the tax burden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shift in Tax Burden: If commercial properties are paying
less due to lower values and successful appeals, but the total amount of money
needed hasn't changed, the tax burden shifts to those whose property values
haven't decreased as much. This often means residential property owners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In short, as we have seen when commercial property values decrease
more than residential ones, and if commercial owners are more successful in
appealing their property taxes, homeowners may see an increase in their
property tax bills at a rate that is not tied to their budges to ensure the
total money needed by the local government is still collected.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc150350510">Map Explainer</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The map provided shows the areas covered by different taxing
agencies in your region. By moving your cursor over the map, you can see
specific information about each agency, like your local school district or the
fire department. This helps you see where your property tax dollars are going.
As you look at the map and the information on each agency, think about the
increases in your tax bill. This map will show you each of the agencies that
are funded by your taxes and might help explain why you're seeing changes in
your property tax bill.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc150350511">Pie Explainer</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pie chart you see breaks down how your property tax is
divided among the local taxing agencies. Each slice of the pie represents a
different agency, like the school district, the police department, or public
works. The size of each slice shows how much of your tax money goes to that
agency. By looking at the pie chart, you can understand how much of your tax
payment is allocated to each service in your community. This visual can help
make sense of how the overall tax increases are shared out and why your bill
might change. Keep in mind those bigger or smaller slices when you remember the
changes in your tax bill.</p>
